### Description

ALL ABOUT POKEMON!!   
This application is an online trading card game based on the Pokemon games that have provided entertainment to many followers and collectors throughout the years.  

A user will sign up and create their "team account" by providing their email and setting a password when prompted.  Once they log in, they will be directed to a page to choose their Pokemon trading cards to build their team.  This application initially allows only six trading cards per team. As you collect and trade your cards, you will find "shiny" cards, although rare. Features like these keep Pokemon fans striving for more "shiny" cards and other "rare collections".

### Status

 * trading between users
 * purchasing additional cards
 * adding more special effects
